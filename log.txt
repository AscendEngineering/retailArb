-the idea
	-scrape pages for items
	-look at ebay and craigslist to see if there are items there that are selling for more
-ok so we are going to need to be able to scrape the page, lets see if python has some good scraping tools
-so we do need to set up access to the at home clusters, and then we need to make sure to set up those emails. from there we can do other stuff like the arbitrage machine
-what we should do is make a script that tries to connect to the machines locally and if that is not an option then we connect to shitech and specify the ports

TODO
__________________________________________________________________
-scrape
	-ebay
	-craigslist
	-facebook marketplace
-someone has done this before, so lets see if we can imitate
	-look up the amazon seller app
	-fullfillment by amazon revenue calculator
-sign up for amazon seller account
-learn more about how retail arbitrage works


DONE
__________________________________________________________________
-write a script that automatically connects us to the local version of our servers, and if that fails connect us remotely
	-nope, it takes way too long for ssh to timeout for a local port, so we are just going to know when we need to connect remotely
	-nevermind, I will just set up a timeout variable...I wonder if the router is smart enough to realize what its ip address is and route the traffic logically...idk
	-yeah this worked
-set up remote connection abilities to server1 and server2
	-make sure duckdns gets updates
	-we dont have to worry about this as long as one of the PC's updates it, and I am pretty sure server2 does this
